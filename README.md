# VideoGame-Review-App

## Description

Welcome to Jessica and Austin's project! This app, written in C# and utilizing the ASP.NET framework, offers a platform for users to add, delete, and update reviews of video games. It's deployed on Azure and can be accessed [here](https://gamesrus.azurewebsites.net/). To ensure a secure experience, we've integrated ASP.NET Core Identity, requiring users to create an account and log in to manage game listings and their associated reviews.
